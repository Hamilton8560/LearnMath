# Back-end

### Getting Started
Back end used pythons Flask HTTPs framework with SQLite database. Will dockerize later.

All questions are stored within the SQLite databse mathflex.db. If Mathflex.db does not exist, it will be automatically created and populated with data.

##### Entry Point
```python3 run.py``` - execute run.py with your python interpreter to run the back-end API.

Will updated this later..
